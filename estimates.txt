Recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO) are two key metrics to consider for a DR plan

RTO - How many hours it takes to return to working state after disaster.
RPO - How much data is lost during a disaster, also expressed in hours.

1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
    * In case of single AZ outage, minimum RTO would be to get updated DNS changes. In case of Multi-AZ deployment, standby instance is already running and data is replicated synchronously. This ensures quick recovery.

2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage
    * In this case, following factors will be considered:
        i) Time to bring read replica as a standalone primary instance: This typically takes 15-20 minutes.
        ii) Time to apply new DNS changes in application to connect to new end point. Depending upon application design this can take anywhere from 15-120 minutes. If application is using centralized key/value management like Hashicorp Vault, change can be done only at one place.
    * To summarize, it can take minimum 45-60 minutes for RTO.

3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
    * In Multi-AZ scenario, automatic backups are enabled. It means AWS will take full snapshot once a day.
    * AWS also does transactional log backups every 5 minutes.
    * However there are other considerations also to be made.
        i) Accidental database deletion: In order to avoid it, we need to enable database deletion protection. Also, add explicit deny policy at IAM level.
        ii) Failure to take auto snapshots: Take manual snapshots.
    * Considering all of this, minimum RPO for a single AZ is 5 minutes.

4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage
    * In Multi-AZ, Multi-region mode, database is updated asynchronously between Primary and read replica.
    * During initial setup and installation time, it takes minimum 15-20 minutes for system to get into Available state.
    * Considering this, minimum RPO for single region outage is around 15 minutes.
